      <h3>About Thomas:</h3>
        <p>
        A citizen of both the US and Canada, Thomas has spent his entire life pursuing a career in classical music. Wanting to avoid so much travel and to be closer to his family, Thomas decided to make a career change and is now training for a career in tech. Currently, he is a student at the <strong><em>Epicodus</em></strong> school in Portland, Oregon. He enjoys the pairs programming format because it forces him to describe and create his code in the presence of others, and learn shortcuts and different points of view. Thomas is married (as of 23 years) with four children ages 20, 20, 10 and 4. He is also a volunteer community basketball coach, and advisor to the youth at his local church. Thomas has had a great time creating webpages thus far at <strong><em>Epicodus</em></strong>.
